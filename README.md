# Coding excercises
Coding exercises in preparation for the upcoming course [Introduction to deep learning for biologists](https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course67/)

## Python - basic skills

These exercises showcase some basic Python concepts, plus the use of most common modules. They are in the form of [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and can be either downloaded and run locally or explored online via platforms such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (a Google account is required).
